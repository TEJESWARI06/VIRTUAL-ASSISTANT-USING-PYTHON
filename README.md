# Python Virtual Assistant

A simple **Virtual Assistant built in Python** that can perform various tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, telling the time, and more. This project demonstrates **speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech synthesis**.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition** using `speech_recognition`  
- **Text-to-Speech** with `pyttsx3`  
- **Web Search** and information retrieval  
- **Date & Time announcements**  
- **Open Applications & Websites** (e.g., Google, YouTube, Notepad)  
- **Extensible and customizable**  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **speech_recognition** → for capturing and processing voice input  
- **pyttsx3** → for text-to-speech conversion  
- **pyaudio** → to access microphone input  
- **wikipedia** → to fetch information  
- **pywhatkit** → for tasks like YouTube playback and searches

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The assistant listens to your voice using the microphone.  
2. Converts the speech into text using `speech_recognition`.  
3. Processes the command using Python logic and libraries.  
4. Executes the task (e.g., web search, open app, tell time).  
5. Responds back with audio output using `pyttsx3`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Smarter Conversations**: Integrate with AI models (like OpenAI GPT) for natural conversations.  
- **Smart Home Integration**: Control IoT devices such as lights, fans, or appliances.  
- **Mobile App Control**: Connect with an Android/iOS app for remote commands.  
- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for different languages.  
- **GUI Dashboard**: Provide a graphical interface for users who prefer clicks over voice.  
- **User Authentication**: Add security features like password or voice recognition.
