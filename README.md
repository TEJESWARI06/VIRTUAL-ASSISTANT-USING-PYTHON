Virtual Assistant using Python
Overview
This project is a Python-based Virtual Assistant that can interact with users through voice and text commands. It uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and natural language processing to perform various automation tasks, making daily activities easier and more efficient.

Features
Accepts voice commands using SpeechRecognition.

Responds with text-to-speech (TTS) using pyttsx3.

Can perform web searches and fetch information.

Provides date, time, and weather updates.

Opens applications and controls basic system functions.

Extendable to send emails, play music, or fetch news.

Technologies Used
Python 3

Libraries:

speech_recognition – for converting speech to text

pyttsx3 – for text-to-speech responses

datetime – for date and time queries

wikipedia – for fetching quick information

os – for system-level operations

How It Works
The assistant listens to the user’s voice through the microphone.

It converts the speech into text using SpeechRecognition.

The command is processed and matched with predefined tasks.

The assistant executes the action (open apps, search the web, give time, etc.).

The response is provided back to the user via text-to-speech.

Python Code
The Python code in this repository handles:

Voice recognition and processing.

Mapping commands to specific actions.

Giving spoken responses using TTS.

Setup
Install Python 3 on your system.

Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia
Run the assistant:

bash
Copy
Edit
python assistant.py
Example Commands
"What is Artificial Intelligence?" → Fetches info from Wikipedia.

"Open YouTube" → Opens YouTube in the browser.

"What time is it?" → Speaks the current time.

"Tell me the date" → Gives today’s date.

Future Improvements
Integrate with Google Calendar and Gmail APIs.

Add machine learning for better intent recognition.

Build a desktop/mobile app interface.

IoT integration for smart home control.
